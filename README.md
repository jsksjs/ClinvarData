# ClinvarData
My CS365 final project that dealt with cleaning up some ClinVar genetic research data,
putting it in a normalized database by our own design, and writing a java application
to interface with said DB using the connector. The application returns all rows that are 
pathogenic and finds the frequency of each pathogenic gene.
